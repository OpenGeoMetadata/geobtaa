It is a feature class within the geodatabase, Vernon_Addresses_2014.gdb.[This data set consists of digital map files containing addressing or site access information obtained predominantly by lab work. Features contained in the data set include all site access points countywide and associated attributes. Site access points sometimes are referred to as addresses, however these data typically represent the intersection of the public road right of way and the private entrance to the property. In the absence of a developed access feature the point represents the location of a line from the primary structure perpendicular to the public road right of way.]",
