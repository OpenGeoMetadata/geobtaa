[This dataset was the result of a 2006 digital map address inventory identification project. The purpose of the project was to identify each geographic address location within Polk County except for the cities and villages. A point map feature was placed at each driveway entrance location that had an existing structure. Beginning in June 2013, address points are being entered in the Cities and Villages. This process is not complete.]",
