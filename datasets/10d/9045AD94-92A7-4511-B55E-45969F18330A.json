  "dc_description_s": "This data group represents hydrography for Sauk County, Wisconsin in 2019 and includes the layers 'Sauk_Hydro_2019_Line' and 'Sauk_Hydro_2019_Poly'.[Line: This feature class is made up of river and stream lines that represent flowlines and cartographic features such as stream centerlines and river banks in Sauk County, WI. The waterlines were digitized off of the Sauk County 2010 1-foot color ortho-imagery at a scale of 1:600. Spatial accuracy is therefore consistent across the entire county. Vertex density varies between streams depending on the sinuosity of that particular stream. Also, vertex density is intentionally higher within city and village boundaries.Poly: This feature class is made up of polygon features representing waterbodies in Sauk County, WI. The waterbodies were digitized off of the Sauk County 2010 1-foot color ortho-imagery at a scale of 1:600. Spatial accuracy is therefore consistent across the entire county. Vertex density varies between streams depending on the sinuosity of that particular stream. Also, vertex density is intentionally higher within city and village boundaries.
