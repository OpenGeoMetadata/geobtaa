"dc_description_s": "This raster dataset has been created using the PAMAP Program Land Cover for Pennsylvania, 2005 (downloaded from PASDA) and Landscape Blocks as originated by The Nature Conservancy. The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources. The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. The road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the Forest cover (Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, and Woody Wetland) raster to assign a value of N0N to areas in the natural vegetation land cover that overlap with the road buffers. Using an inside buffer of 300 feet on the Forest cover (Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, and Woody Wetland) from the 2005 land cover, the interior forest raster was created. Acreage of the contiguous interior forest was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows: Acreage Conservation Value 0-20 0 20-100 1 100-250 2 250-500 3 500-1000 4 1000-2500 5 2500-5000 6 5000-10000 7 10000-15000 8 15000-20000 9 >20000 10 No data 0 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall terrestrial resources conservation value raster for the Central Appalachian Forest Ecoregion. Therefore the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input terrestrial resources data. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value.",
